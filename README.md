# Creative Coding

## Why I am doing this?
**Short answer**: Just because :nerd_face:

**Slightly longer answer:** When I was studying engineering physics, the courses I enjoyed the most where the 
ones where my imagination was my tool to understand what was happening (e.g. Classical Mechanics, 
Electrodynamics, Heat Transfer and sometimes Statistical Mechanics) :thought_balloon:

When I was doing my Social Service at the Faculty, I realized that I enoyed explaining mathematical and 
physical concepts by creating visualizations and graphs (check some of the plots and visualizations I made 
[here](https://github.com/isaacarroyov/ss_plots)). Thanks to YouTube channels such as 
[**3Blue1Brown**](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) or 
[**Zach Star**](https://www.youtube.com/c/zachstar), I could understand what's behind and how to use mathematical 
concepts from Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Probability and Statistics :chart_with_upwards_trend:

As I said before, I enjoy visualizations and imagining things, and I want to combine that with programming. 
So that's why I'm doing this. :nerd_face:

## What is in this repository?
I'm currently learning JavaScript by creating visualizations, I heard that it is something called 
_**Creative Coding**_, sounds amazing, right? :open_mouth:

In this GitHub repository, you can watch my JavaScript progress as I create different kinds of visualizations. 
Some of them could be data-related, and others would be just random stuff :sweat_smile:

## Content
Each project has its folder and a **`README.md`** file with a description (if it's necessary) and the link 
to the source code.
